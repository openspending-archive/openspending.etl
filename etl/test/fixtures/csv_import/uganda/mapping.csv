This is necessary to avoid double-counting when showing aggregations (of Government of Uganda spending, budget support and project aid) at higher levels, but it does not affect the actual amounts in the projects. Budget Support is money given directly to the government which they can spend on their own priorities. General Budget Support is given directly to the Treasury or Finance Ministry, and Sector Budget Support is given to an individual sector. Because of the nature of budget support, it is impossible to accurately track it through the system down to an individual project level. Below the higher levels, budget support thus becomes part of Government of Uganda revenues.",,,,
